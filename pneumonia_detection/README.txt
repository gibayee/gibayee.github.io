#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description:
This project demonstrates an AI-powered pneumonia detection system using deep learning. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze X-ray images and predict whether a given image depicts pneumonia or not. The system processes the image, performs necessary preprocessing, and uses a pre-trained model to generate a prediction result that is displayed on a webpage.

The project includes multiple components, such as:

- **A Web Interface**: This allows users to upload X-ray images.
- **A Server**: The image is saved to the server, where it is processed.
- **A Pre-trained Model**: The model processes the image and predicts the presence of pneumonia.
- **A Results Display**: The prediction result is shown on the webpage.

This system demonstrates the application of deep learning in medical imaging, showcasing its potential in real-time diagnostics and healthcare automation.

### Project Structure

1. **Web Interface**
   - The front end of the application provides users with an easy-to-use interface where they can upload X-ray images. The interface is built with modern web technologies, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Server-Side Logic**
   - Once an image is uploaded, it is sent to the server. The server handles the image storage and passes it to the pre-trained model for analysis.
   
3. **Pre-trained Model**
   - The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically trained on X-ray images for pneumonia detection. The CNN consists of three convolutional layers, followed by max pooling and dense layers for classification. It is capable of providing high accuracy in detecting the presence of pneumonia in the images.

4. **Prediction & Results**
   - After processing the image, the model predicts whether the X-ray indicates the presence of pneumonia. This result is then displayed to the user in an easily understandable format.

### Key Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: A popular deep learning library used to train and deploy the CNN model.
- **Flask**: A Python-based web framework that is used for creating the web interface and handling requests.
- **OpenCV**: A computer vision library used for image processing.
- **Matplotlib**: A library used for plotting and visualizing model performance during training.

### Files and Their Purpose

- **app.py**: This file contains the backend logic of the application, including routes for uploading images and interacting with the model.
- **model.py**: Defines and compiles the CNN model for pneumonia detection.
- **static/**: Contains static files like images, stylesheets, and scripts for the web interface.
- **templates/**: Contains HTML templates for the web interface.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the required Python packages to run the project.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project and its components.
  
### Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the images to the model, several preprocessing steps are performed:
1. **Rescaling**: Pixel values are normalized to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing the pixel values by 255. This ensures that the model receives input values that are consistent and conducive to training.
2. **Resizing**: Images are resized to 256x256 pixels to ensure consistency across all input images. This step allows the model to process images in a uniform shape.

### Model Architecture

The model architecture is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification:
- **Convolutional Layers**: These layers extract relevant features from the input images.
- **Max Pooling Layers**: These layers reduce the dimensionality of the data, which helps in reducing computational complexity.
- **Dense Layers**: These layers are used for classification based on the features extracted by the convolutional layers.

### Design Choices

- **Why CNN?**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for image processing tasks due to their ability to extract hierarchical features from images. In this project, the CNN model efficiently analyzes X-ray images to detect pneumonia.
- **Why Flask for the Web Interface?**: Flask was chosen due to its simplicity and flexibility in building small-scale web applications. It integrates well with the Python-based machine learning pipeline and serves as a robust backend for the project.
- **Why Resizing Images?**: Resizing ensures that all input images are of uniform dimensions, which is necessary for feeding them into the CNN. Standardizing image size is critical for model training and inference.

### Future Enhancements

- **Model Improvement**: Further improvements can be made to the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters or using a more complex pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet or VGG).
- **User Experience**: Enhancing the web interface for more user-friendly interaction, such as adding a progress bar for image uploading and prediction processing.
- **Deployment**: The project can be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku to allow more users to interact with the model in real-time.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning and deep learning techniques can be used in medical diagnostics. The system is capable of accurately identifying pneumonia in X-ray images, showing the potential for real-world applications in healthcare. By making this tool accessible via a web interface, healthcare professionals can easily make faster diagnoses, ultimately improving patient care.
